Quick and dirty test of multibytes nop

All nop are working on a x86 
All nop are well decoded on a old IDA6
All Nop are well decoded on x32dbg debug work (v25 Compiled 29/04/17)
Immunity debugger (v1.85) Don't understand NOP3 to NOP9 and fail to debug
Radare2 well decode all... (I know a old one v2014-12-03)
OllyDbg don't understand NOP5, NOP6, NOP8 and NOP9 but the debug works (v 2.00.01)

Troll Conclusion... use Radare2
